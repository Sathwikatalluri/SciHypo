SCIHYPO- A Deep Learning Framework for Data-Driven Scientific Hypotheses Generation from Extensive Literature Analysis.SCIHYPO is a web based project and uses Deep Learning Frameworks to generate fresh hypotheses by analyzing scientific literature.
It identifies existing research patterns, relationships, latent connections and allows it to generate hypotheses across diverse scientific fields.
It employs advanced NLP techniques like Generative Pre-Trained models and self-attention models. Designed an intuitive user interface using Tkinter, allowing researchers to input queries and receive summarized, coherent reports of relevant literature.
Technologies Used: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, Python, Frameworks(OpenCV, Dlib, Numpy), HTML, CSS, Tkinter for user interface
